# Home_Value_Prediction documentation!

## Description

This is a final project for one of my graduate courses. For the final project, I wanted to create a model that can accurately predict a given property value. As an investor, it is crucial to have tools to analyze and detect undervalued real estate properties. A model that can predict a home's value can assist in ROI calculations for undervalued homes, aiding in the decision-making process. Such a model will improve the due diligence process of property assessment and mitigate the risks of tying up capital in homes with low ROI.
